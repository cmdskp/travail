==================================

Depends:
--------
default

Notes:
------
This is a hobby project, not a full release.
It's provided as-is and offers no assurances of function, reliability, support, etc.
It is free though! :)  It was uploaded here, on request by one person, and to provide an origin of who the mod came from.
Plus, it gives something for nothing to any willing to delve into its inner workings.
 
  
I don't wish attention for this(hence, why no project tags), as that tends to get messy and require lots more time spent
on minor things, but github only allows public projects.  If you find something useful from it though, that's good.

Features:
---------
	In unprotected areas, occasionally removes unsurrounded water source blocks to clear up.
	Nightlight block - switches on/off with day/night cycle or on right-click.
	Muddy water - when water source near dirt or when water next to muddy water.
	(Many other things, yet to write up - see code)
